This lil flask app allows to parse json nuclei result easly to make it more easy to understable.

To install the prerequisties, run the following installation commands :
```pip install flask flask_wtf```
The other packages should be installed. I list them here, maybe you dont have it installed :
1. json
2. yaml

4. pathlib
5. csv

Once you're done with installation, please run :
